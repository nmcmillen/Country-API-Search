# Country-API-Search

This is a basic search that provides certain stats about a country when input into the search bar.

The search will only provide information back if the first letter of the country name is uppercase with the remaining letters lowercase. (Example: United States, Spain, etc.)

When the country name is entered and you hit "enter" or the magnifying glass, it will return the country flag with:

Capital
Population
Area (in kilometers squared)
Bordering Countries
Subregion
The background image will also change to a picture of or relating to the country searched (or anything relating to what you put submit in the search bar for that matter)
